Now that we have looked at our data to make sure that it is high quality, and removed low-quality base calls, we can perform variant calling to see how the population changed over time. We care how this population changed relative to the original population, *E. coli* strain REL606. Therefore, we will align each of our samples to the *E. coli* REL606 reference genome, and see what differences exist in our reads versus the genome.\n",

Luckily, we already know the tools we need to use to automate this workflow and run it on as many files as we want using a single line of code. Those tools are: wildcards, for loops, and bash scripts. We will use all three in the next lesson.\n",
